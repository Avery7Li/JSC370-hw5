## Top 10 Players for 4 Skills

The scatterplot below decomposes the top 10 rankings for the 4 skills, where the color of the marker indicates the tactical skill while the shape indicates the player position. The 16 teams on the y-axis are ordered by the preliminary round team rank from top to bottom. The x-axis corresponds to the rank from 1 to 10, so each vertical line would have four pins for the four skills. The player name is shown on the popup text when hovering over the marker.
